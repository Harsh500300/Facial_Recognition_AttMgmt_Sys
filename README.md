# Facial_Recognition_AttMgmt_Sys
It's created with the intention to reduce attendance based workloads on teachers because this automatically mark the attendace of students by recognizing their faces. So due to this the workloads which is upon teachers
is reduced. And, thanks to OpenCv,matplotib,pandas,streamlit and other libraries which'll make this project workable.

This repo contains three file addfaces.py,app.py,test.py :

Here each file having their individual role like **addfaces.py** is used to add faces of students of class, **test.py** is used for testing the project or called marking the attendance of students but only for those students
which is already enroll or add their face in this project, and **app.py** is used to upload attendance data on webserver.

**How to use**:
Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.Then,Extracting the content of that ZIP file to a local directory.
Open the addfaces.py,test.py and app.py file on Pycharm(Any code editor).Now,you'll able to use facial recognition based attendance management system.

**Before Using These fiel make sure you install all these libraries in your pc with a suitable path**:
dlib,cmake,opencv,matplotib,pandas,streamlit,cv2,pickle,numpy
e.g. pip install dlib (some like this)
e.g. import cv2 (some like this// these are already used in code no need to change)
